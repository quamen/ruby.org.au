      <p><strong>New People into the Community Project</strong> - Amanda Neumann</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Mostly working this month on Sponsorship and Meetup organised.</li>
      
      <li>Met with a bunch of people who are wanting to help and got a lot of feedback, we’ve been fairly busy since then</li>
      
      <li>Identified a starting point - the website, colate the resources to find things and get in touch with the committee on events and info they need to know - we need input from the committee or other items regarding that.</li>
      
      <li>Mikel: Make a slack channel on it</li>
      
      <li>I’ll make a trello for this</li>
      
      <li>Rob: Talk to Rachelle as well regarding this</li>
      
      <li>Design needs a refresh, work with SEO as well, our website is something should be good enough for every event to announce it</li>
      
      <li>Mel is consolidating groups for meetup.com so that this is all organised into a cental body</li>
      
      <li>Getting juniors into Dev positions - still open for lots of discussion</li>
      
      <li>Mikel: Mentioned fairfax / reinteractive mentoring idea on getting a list of developers and pairing up with juniors for a 3 month 2 hour per week stint with company making time for it to happen. Will get more details next meeting.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li>
      <p><strong>Ruby to the Business Project Update</strong> - John Barton</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Survey
      <ul>
      <li>Didn’t complete the startup Victoria item.</li>
      
      <li>Survey needs to be industry focused as the less focused it is the less likely it is to complete (gave examples of survey questions)</li>
      
      <li>One question is “before this survey were you aware of Ruby Australia?”</li>
      
      <li>Get a survey out that is fully anonymous</li>
      
      <li>But we should be able to have a signup form for Ruby Australia membership</li>
      
      <li>Need to be more representative of the community once we get the survey out</li>
      
      <li>Want to get the questions approved, will do a pull request to the slack room</li>
      
      <li>Amanda: Who does this go to? John: Anyone that has written Ruby.</li>
      
      <li>Goal is to get thousands filling it out, need to leverage our contacts as a team and get it happening as a game in the community.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li>RMIT + Last few years have spoken to RMIT Systems Architecture class, they still only teach Perl as their one dynamic language, the survey will help show the number of jobs available to Ruby developers and they can switch off Perl.
      <ul>
      <li>RMIT Lecturer is interested in getting a talk from a Ruby person</li>
      
      <li>Mikel: Could do an installfest at RMIT on this point</li>
      
      <li>I’ll email them and suggest</li>
      </ul>

      </ol>
      
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Beting companies sponsorsing events (John) + John: I personally feel that we shouldn’t align our community with betting companies</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Mikel: I agree, but we can’t ban it as we don’t run all the events</li>
      
      <li>Matt: Needs to be a clear statement, we don’t have a right to ban</li>
      
      <li>Mikel proposed writing up a statement to this effect as a PR on the ruby.org.au website and then doing a mailing to the mailing list for any strong detractors - all agreed</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li>
      <p>RailsCamp ticket for committee members</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Mikel: Pointed out some angst and upset about this</li>
      
      <li>Matt: Maybe needs to be clearer on how this works with regards why, could have been announced better</li>
      
      <li>Len: Should be clear these are purchased and not are free</li>
      
      <li>Rob: More of a problem we announced without co-ordination at all</li>
      
      <li>John: Most of the recent ballots didn’t fill up enough</li>
      
      <li>Sebastian: I don’t feel we can announce we volunteer more than anyone, we don’t know that is true at all</li>
      
      <li>Sebastian: We wanted to make sure we could hold a general meeting and felt it was important for committee members to be at the general meeting, we solved that by Committee members can always just arrvie for the GM</li>
      
      <li>Sebastian: It is interesting that every other time we have run a ballot no one has missed out, so this is interesting.</li>
      
      <li>Sebastian: I don’t think we need to mandate it.</li>
      
      <li>Matt: I think this needs to be online</li>
      
      <li>Mikel: We could do it online</li>
      
      <li>Sebastian: we could link up rooms on this</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
