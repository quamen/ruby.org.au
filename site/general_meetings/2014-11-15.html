      <h2 id="treasurers_report_2">Treasurer’s Report</h2>
      
      <p>Hi there,</p>
      
      <p>Below is my full report for the financial status of Ruby Australia Incorporated as of the 15th of November 2014.</p>
      
      <p>As this camp forms the end of my 2 year term as Treasurer, I would like to thank all the committee - both past and present, for their support and hard work over the last two years. It has been an honour and privilege to be able to serve with you, and to be able to support an organisation that is working so hard to improve our community in a supportive and inclusive way.</p>
      
      <p>The attached files form the financial report as of 15th November 2014 for Ruby Australia Incorporated.</p>
      
      <p>The past 6 months have been busy for the association, with this Railscamp in planning and the initial payments being made for RubyConfAU 2015. Along with this, Ruby Australia has been providing banking services for the Melbourne RORO meet-up, including invoicing sponsors and handling expense claims. We are currently in the process of exploring how we can help support the Perth RORO meet-up.</p>
      
      <p>Over the past year we have continued to streamline our accounting process, both with the help of event organisers and through advice provided to us by Interactive Accounting. As part of that, I would like to thank all the event organisers for both their support in completing our financial obligations, but also their patience and tolerance when things haven’t gone quite to plan.</p>
      
      <p>The last major event was the Brisbane Railscamp which completed with a minor loss of $856. In my opinion, this is preferable to a camp turning a large profit as camp events are a great time to keep ticket costs low to ensure they are able to be attended by as many of our community as possible.</p>
      
      <p>The association is in a very stable place financially, and our event organisers should be congratulated for their great work making sure this is the case.</p>
      
      <p>As of today, we have the following balances in the bank:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>General and Railscamp: $60,310.71</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
      <p>Savings: $43,435.76</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
      <p>Conferences: $7,446.62</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
      <p>Total: $111,193.09.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>It should be noted that a large amount of the funds from General and Railscamp are the result of RubyConf AU 2015 ticket sales, but have yet to be transferred into the conference working account. This is expected to be completed in the next few weeks.</p>
      
      <p>Attached to this email are the following:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>A financial report audited by Interactive Accounting for the year ending 30 June 2014.</li>
      
      <li>A profit &amp; loss report for the last Railscamp held in Brisbane.</li>
      
      <li>A profit &amp; loss report for for the 3 months ending September 2014 (our last audit period).</li>
      
      <li>The full Business Activity report for the quarter ending September 2014.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>I can be reached for any questions at treasurer@ruby.org.au, or you can always reach out to me on Twitter or at any future events.</p>
      
      <p>Finally, I would like to nominate Matthew Allen as my replacement as Treasurer.</p>
      
      <p>Best regards,<br /> Jason Stirk<br /> Treasurer Outgoing<br /> Ruby Australia, Inc.</p>
